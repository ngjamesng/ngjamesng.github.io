Hello everyone from R14,

I've been watching "The Office" lately, and I found joke.
1. What do you call __proto__? Dunder proto 
2. Michael Scott was the regional manager where? __mifflin__

Anyway, I'm so glad we're all able to make it through the bootcamp. I miss everyone! 
I know finding that first job is hard, but keep it up, trust the process! 
When we're all able to meet again, let's hang. 

- James
